## Title of your application
## Introduction

The group projectâ€™s main goal is to create a telegram bot, that aims to provide a convenient way for users to book and manage meeting rooms in University Utara Malaysia . The program stores all data in an SQLite database and automatically deletes data after a week. A daemon thread is also implemented to monitor the data every day. The telegram bot has been specifically designed for the purpose of booking rooms within the University Utara Malaysia (UUM), is directed towards two main user groups, namely school administrators and users.
The capacity to update existing rooms' unique identification numbers, descriptions, room types, and maximum capacities is given to school administrators in addition to the ability to build new rooms. The accommodation booking procedure is made simpler and more effective for frequent users thanks to this feature, which guarantees that the data provided by the bot is correct and current.
To further facilitate the booking process, the bot also offers a thorough list of rooms that are available and are accessible to users. Before confirming their bookings, users can also edit their personal information through the bot, as well as adjust the specifics of their reservations, like the type of rooms they're booking and the time and date of their reservation.This bot is designed to accommodate a wide range of room sizes, from small ones to large ones, meeting the various needs of the user community. The bot can also produce a list of every user's information who reserved a room.This feature allows for easy management and tracking of room bookings. This Telegram bot aims to improve the booking process and provide a more user-friendly experience for school administrators and users.

The step-by-step guidelines to deploy a Java Telegram bot to Heroku:




## User manual/guideline for testing the system

**ADMIN**<br>

When an admin initiates a conversation with the bot by sending the command "/start", they will be greeted with a welcoming message. They will then be presented with two options to choose from: option 1 for registration, and option 2 for login. To proceed, the admin simply has to reply to the bot with their desired choice.
